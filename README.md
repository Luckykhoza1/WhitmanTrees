# WhitmanTrees
The goal of this project is to build a website for Whitman College that will track over 6000 trees. Users will login using their Whitman credentials via Whitman SSO. Features of the project include authentication, comments, content moderation, and search queries. Frameworks used include Django, CAS, AWS databases, ArcGIS map, and Bootstrap.

The project is still under development, it's not yet available to the public. I hope you enjoy the video of the current demo. Here is a link to watch it.
